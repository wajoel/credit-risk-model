## Credit Risk Prediction in R

### üìå Project Overview
This project aims to predict **credit risk** using statistical and machine learning models. We analyze a dataset containing customer demographic and financial information, applying techniques like **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**. Advanced visualizations help us explore patterns and assess model performance.

### üìÇ Dataset Description
The dataset consists of the following variables:

| Variable          | Description                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Age             | Age of the applicant                             |
| Sex             | Gender of the applicant                         |
| Job             | Job classification                             |
| Housing         | Type of housing (Own, Rent, Free)               |
| Saving.accounts | Savings account balance category                |
| Checking.account | Checking account balance category              |
| Credit.amount   | Loan/Credit amount requested                    |
| Duration        | Loan duration in months                         |
| Purpose        | Purpose of the credit (car, education, business) |
| Credit.risk     | Target variable (1 = High Risk, 0 = Low Risk)   |

### üõ† Methods Used

   - **Random Forest**: Ensemble learning technique for improving prediction accuracy.
   - **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting algorithm for optimizing model performance.

3. **Model Evaluation Metrics**
   - Confusion Matrix
   - ROC Curve & AUC
   - Feature Importance
   - Calibration & Lift Curves
